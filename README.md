##  Project Summary

This project allows a user to simply provide a **topic**, and the AI takes care of:
-  **Writing a compelling post**
-  **(Optionally) Generating a relevant image using AI**
-  **Posting it directly on LinkedIn**

All steps are done automatically, with no human input needed after giving the topic.

---

##  How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide a topic (e.g., `"AI bot that writes and posts on Reddit automatically"`).
2. **Generate**: AI writes the post content using LangChain.
3. **Decision Engine**: Based on the state, it:
   - Posts with or without an image,
   - Or generates the image if required.
4. **Post**: The final content is uploaded to LinkedIn.
